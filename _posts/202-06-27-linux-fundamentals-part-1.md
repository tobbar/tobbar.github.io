task 1 intro

This room is the first part in the Linux Fundamental rooms in this room we will learn three topics

- Introduction To Linux
- Executing Commands and Man Pages
- Basic File Operators

task 2 Methodology


After careful consideration, I've deemed the best way to go about this is to introduce various concepts in sections, with each section being more complex and requiring knowledge from the previous section. To better enable the transition between section, I've split each section into different users in the VM; when you finish a section you'll have to complete a challenge and then you'll be able to move onto the next section.

Task 3 Basic Command Execution

in this task we will learn about the first command (echo) echo used to output any words after it like ~$ echo b3t3tes  the output will be b3t3tes

Task 8 [Section 3: Basic File Operations] - Running A Binary

in this task we will learn about binary and relative path **binaries** are files that contain compiled source code


|Relative Path|Meaning|Absolute Path|Relative Path|Running a binary with a Relative Path|Running A Binary with an Absolute Path|
| :- | :- | :- | :- | :- | :- |
|.|Current Directory|/tmp/aaÂ |.|./hello|/tmp/aa/hello|
|..|Directory before the current directory|/tmp|..|../hello|/tmp/hello|
|~|The user's home directory|/home/<current user>|~|~/hello|/home/<user>/hello|

Q:How would you run a binary called hello using the directory shortcut . ?

A:./hello
