# Task 2 Introduction

### Q: What networking constructs are used to direct traffic to the right application on a server?

#### A: Ports

### Q: How many of these are available on any network-enabled computer?

#### A: 65535

### Q: How many of these are considered "well-known"? (These are the "standard" numbers mentioned in the task)

#### A: 1024

# Task 3 Nmap Switches

### Q: What is the first switch listed in the help menu for a 'Syn Scan' (more on this later!)?

#### A: -sS

### Q: Which switch would you use for a "UDP scan"?

#### A: -sU

### Q: If you wanted to detect which operating system the target is running on, which switch would you use?

#### A: -O

### Q: Nmap provides a switch to detect the version of the services running on the target. What is this switch?

#### A: -sV

### Q: The default output provided by nmap often does not provide enough information for a pentester. How would you increase the verbosity?

#### A: -v

### Q: Verbosity level one is good, but verbosity level two is better! How would you set the verbosity level to two?

#### A: -vv

### Q: What switch would you use to save the nmap results in three major formats?

#### A: -oA

### Q: What switch would you use to save the nmap results in a "normal" format?

#### A: -oN

### Q: A very useful output format: how would you save results in a "grepable" format?

#### A: -oG

### Q: How would you activate this setting?

#### A: -A

### Q: How would you set the timing template to level 5?

#### A: -T5

### Q: How would you tell nmap to only scan port 80?

#### A: -p 80

### Q: How would you tell nmap to scan ports 1000-1500?

#### A: -p 1000-1500

### Q: How would you tell nmap to scan *all* ports?

#### A: -p-

### Q: How would you activate a script from the nmap scripting library (lots more on this later!)?

#### A: --script

### Q: How would you activate all of the scripts in the "vuln" category?

#### A: --script=vuln

# Task 5 TCP Connect Scans

### Q: Which RFC defines the appropriate behavior for the TCP protocol?

#### A: RFC 793

### Q: If a port is closed, which flag should the server send back to indicate this?

#### A: RST

# Task 6  SYN Scans

### Q: There are two other names for a SYN scan, what are they?

#### A: Half-Open, Stealth

### Q: Can Nmap use a SYN scan without Sudo permissions (Y/N)?

#### A: N

# Task 7  UDP Scans

### Q: If a UDP port doesn't respond to an Nmap scan, what will it be marked as?

#### A: open|filtered

### Q: When a UDP port is closed, by convention the target should send back a "port unreachable" message. Which protocol would it use to do so?

#### A: ICMP

# Task 8 NULL, FIN and Xmas

### Q: Which of the three shown scan types uses the URG flag?

#### A: xmas

### Q: Why are NULL, FIN and Xmas scans generally used?

#### A: Firewall Evasion

### Q: Which common OS may respond to a NULL, FIN or Xmas scan with a RST for every port?

#### A: Microsoft Windows

# Task 9  ICMP Network Scanning

### Q: How would you perform a ping sweep on the 172.16.x.x network (Netmask: 255.255.0.0) using Nmap? (CIDR notation)

#### A: nmap -sn 172.16.0.0/16

# Task 10 NSE Scripts Overview

### Q: What language are NSE scripts written in?

#### A: Lua

### Q: Which category of scripts would be a *very* bad idea to run in a production environment?

#### A: intrusive

# Task 11 NSE Scripts Working with the NSE

### Q: What optional argument can the ftp-anon.nse script take?

#### A: maxlist

# Task 12 NSE Scripts Searching for Scripts

### Q: Search for "smb" scripts in the /usr/share/nmap/scripts/ directory using either of the demonstrated methods. 
What is the filename of the script which determines the underlying OS of the SMB server?

#### A: smb-os-discovery.nse

### Q: Read through this script. What does it depend on?

#### A: smb-brute

# Task 13 Firewall Evasion

### Q: Which simple (and frequently relied upon) protocol is often blocked, requiring the use of the -Pn switch?

#### A: ICMP

### Q: Which Nmap switch allows you to append an arbitrary length of random data to the end of packets?

#### A: --data-length

# Task 14 Practical

### Q: Does the target (MACHINE\_IP)respond to ICMP (ping) requests (Y/N)?

#### A: N

### Q: Perform an Xmas scan on the first 999 ports of the target -- how many ports are shown to be open or filtered?

#### A: 999

### Q: Perform a TCP SYN scan on the first 5000 ports of the target -- how many ports are shown to be open?

#### A: 5
